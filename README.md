# React Application to provide food ordering service

## Description

The repository for the course React v19. The course introduces the basic ideas step by step and explains the most advanced methods of working with React.

It includes creating a modern SPA application using React, configuring Redux, and integrating React Router. At the final stage, the application is migrated to Next.js. Rendering types and optimization techniques are also being explained.

The classic architecture of React applications is described: Unidirectional dataflow, implemented using the Redux library.

It also includes an introduction to framework Next.js, and application optimization knowledge.
